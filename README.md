## Hydra Renderer
The Hydra Renderer consists of 3 heads:

- End User Plugin (3ds max or else)
- HydraAPI (infrastructure)
- HydraCore (render engine, compute core)

This repo contain the last one.

# Build and install

Windows:
1. Clone HydraAPI repo is some folder (for example "myfolder/HydraAPI"). 
2. Build HydraAPI with visual studio 2015 or later under windows.
3. Clone HydraCore repo in the same folder (to form "myfolder/HydraCore").
4. Set **"inDevelopment = false"** inside "input.cpp". 
5. Build HydraCore with visual studio 2015 or later under windows.
6. Run shadepack (set it as a startup ptoject and then press Ctr+F5).
7. Move all ".xx" files from "HydraCore/hydra_drv/shaders" to "C:/[Hydra]/bin2/shaders/".
8. Copy file "texproc.cl" from "HydraCore/hydra_drv/shaders" to "C:/[Hydra]/bin2/shaders/".
9. Copy files "cfetch.h" and "cglobals.h" from "HydraCore/hydra_drv" to "C:/[Hydra]/bin2/shaders/"
10. Copy hydra.exe from "HydraCore/hydra_app/x64/Release" to "C:/[Hydra]/bin2"
11. Delete all files inside  "C:/[Hydra]/bin2/shadercache/" if you have them. This will clear Hydra shader cache.


Linux:
1. Clone HydraAPI repo in some folder (for example "myfolder/HydraAPI"). 
2. Build HydraAPI with Cmake.
3. Clone HydraCore repo in the same folder (to form "myfolder/HydraCore").
4. Set **"inDevelopment = false"** inside "input.cpp". 
5. Use the following command to build and install HydraCore (for example from "myfolder/HydraCore/build")   
**cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/YourUserName .. && make all install -j 4**

# Command line by examples

* simple image render
```bash
hydra -inputlib "tests/test_42" -out "/home/frol/temp/z_out.png" -nowindow 1 
```

* simple image render (takes statefile "tests/test_42/statex_00012.xml")
```bash
hydra -inputlib "tests/test_42" -statefile "statex_00012.xml" -out "/home/frol/temp/z_out.png" -nowindow 1 
```

* rendering on 2 GPUs via OS shared memory (via HydraAPI only!)
```bash
hydra -nowindow 1 -inputlib "tests/test_42" -width 1024 -height 768 -cpu_fb 0 -sharedimage hydraimage_1533639330288 -cl_device_id 0
hydra -nowindow 1 -inputlib "tests/test_42" -width 1024 -height 768 -cpu_fb 0 -sharedimage hydraimage_1533639330288 -cl_device_id 1
```

# Building Embree (if you need it for some reason under your custom OS)

Unix:

1. Clone embree2 (we used 2.17 last time). **#NOTE:** do not use embree3, it will not work.
2. install cmake curces (ccmake).
3. mkdir build
4. ccmake ..
5. set EMBREE_MAX_ISA to SSE2 **#NOTE:** this is important! Other will not work due to different BVH layout.
6. set EMBREE_TASKING_SYSTEM to INTERNAL
7. set EMBREE_STATIC_LIB to ON
8. build embree. Press 'c', then 'g' and quit from ccmake. Then exec "make -j 4".
   Make sure everything works (for example any of their samples). 
9. copy all files from "HydraCore/bvh_builder" to "embree2/tutorials/bvh_access". Replace all.
10. exec "make -j 4" from "embree2/build" folder again.
    Now you should get "libhydrabvhbuilder.a" inside "embree2/build" folder.
11. Copy several files to "HydraCore/LIBRARY/lib_x64_linux" (or configure your own OS folder via CMake):
    libembree.a
    libhydrabvhbuilder.a
    liblexers.a
    libsimd.a
    libsys.a
    libtasking.a

Windows:

It's almost the same except that you need to pack all to the single "bvh_builder.dll" file. \
We usually edit project for "embree2/tutorials/bvh_access" in Visual Studio. \
So, you don't have to replace "embree2/tutorials/bvh_access/CMakeLists.txt" with "HydraCore/bvh_builderCMakeLists.txt".

# Licence and dependency

HydraCore uses MIT licence itself, however it depends on the other software as follows (see doc/licence directory):

* 02 - FreeImage Public License - Version 1.0 (FreeImage is used in the form of binaries)
* 03 - Embree Apache License 2.0 (Embree is used in the form of binaries)
* 04 - xxhash BSD 3-clause "New" or "Revised" (xxhash is used in the form of sources)
* 05 - pugixml MIT licence (pugixml is used in the form of sources)

* 08 - glad MIT licence (glad is used in form of generated source code).
* 09 - glfw BSD-like license (glfw is used in form of binaries only for demonstration purposes).

Most of them are simple MIT-like-licences without any serious restrictions. 
So in general there should be no problem to use HydraCore in your open source or commercial projects. 

However if you find that for some reason you can't use one of these components, please let us know!
Most of these components can be replaced.
